    Hello everyone! My name is Wanqiu Raymer. I live in Troy Michigan, and I work in a Catholic school called Notre Dame Preparatory School and Marist Academy. 
    I currently teach the Chinese language and culture to middle and high school students. This year is my 10th year teaching. I have always worked as a 
    Chinese teacher. I have worked in different grades and schools over the years. When I first started, I worked in a small district and covered two elementary
    schools. I still remember that there was one day a week, I traveled to the other school in the middle of the day. Later I moved to middle school and high 
    school. I missed my days with the younger students. They are so funny! I have my master's degree in teaching and curriculum and am certified to teach 
    Chinese to k-12 students. After 10 years, I decided to expand my career. I am now working towards my educational specialist in technology degree. 
    I am hoping that this course can help me get a better understanding of website development and lay a good foundation for becoming a technology integration 
    specialist in the future. In my spare time, I enjoy the outdoor activities and try to stay outside as much as possible.
