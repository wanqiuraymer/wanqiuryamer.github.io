    <h3> Educator Credentials</h3>
    <main>
        <p>I received my bachelor's degree in English education in 2007 and a master’s degree in English Culture Studies with a focus on Australia in 2012. In the same year, I left China and came to the United State for my master's degree in teaching and curriculum at Michigan State University. Now I am pursuing my educational specialist in technology degree at University of Missouri – Columbia with a focus on technology in schools. I am hoping to complete my study and receive my degree in 2024. I currently hold Michigan Professional Teaching Certificate and I am certified to teach Chinese language and culture to k-12 students. I am also studying for my Google certificate in IT support. </p>
